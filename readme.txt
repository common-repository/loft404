A toolkit to redirect 404 page to your custom page.

== Description ==

Loft404 is a small plugin to help redirect the default 404 page to a custom page. You can choose to enable it, then set the custom 404 page.

PS: The plugin does not create a custom 404 page for your site. You need to create a page and add content to it. By working with our another WP plugin [LoftBuilder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loftbuilder/), you can easily create a beautiful page in minutes.

= Features & Options =
* Turn on or off the custom 404 page.
* Set any existing page as the custom 404 page.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory).
2. Activate the Loft404 plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. In the WordPress administration screen, go to Settings > Loft404, check the settings there.
